### Sample Answer
I design fallback experiences, monitor failures, and respond quickly to incidents. Users should always have a safe, understandable path forward when AI fails.

---

## 11. How do you decide what stays in the model vs in the product logic?

### What the interviewer is evaluating
Architectural judgment.

### What you should learn
- Separation of concerns  
- Maintainability  

### How to answer
Emphasize stability.

### Sample Answer
Stable rules, validation, and workflows stay in product logic, while models handle language understanding and generation. This improves reliability and maintainability.

---

## 12. How do you test AI-powered features?

### What the interviewer is evaluating
Quality assurance mindset.

### What you should learn
- Automated testing  
- Human evaluation
